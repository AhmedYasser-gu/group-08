# What are we making?

We will endeavour to make a system to control the emulated car in the tool provided to us. We will write code for the emulated car to give it the capabilities we desire as well as create an interface with which to control the car.
The following is a list of the features of the system we plan to develop develop: \
      1: The car will be controllable using a joystick or "arrow key" like interface. \
      2: The car will be controllable with voice commands. \
      3: The car will be controllable via a map with pathfinding functionalities.
      
# Why are we making it? What problems does it solve?

By making the car be controllable with voice commands we hope to make it accessible to people unable to manually operate a computer and possibly more convenient. Autonomous navigation will make it much simpler for a user to move the car to a desired point. They can do so with many fewer inputs than if they were to steer the car themselves.

# How are we going to make it?

To build the system described above we are planning to use the following coding languages: Swift, Python and C++.

### Swift

![alt-text](https://github.com/DIT112-V21/group-08/blob/readme-update/Pathfinder%20iOS%20App/NodeMap.gif) We use Swift and SwiftUI to build the app which is responsible for presenting the map of the surrounding area as well as using pathfinding algorithms to find a path to a desired location. The app generates a set of instructions for the car to follow.
